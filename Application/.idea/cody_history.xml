                <text value=" Here are a few things you could try to prevent the non-host client from creating multiple games repeatedly:&#10;&#10;1. Add a flag or state variable to track if a game is already created. Before creating a new game, check this flag and only create if it is false. Set the flag to true after creating a game.&#10;&#10;2. On the non-host client, only attempt to create a game if one doesn't already exist in the database. You can check for existence by querying the database before creating.&#10;&#10;3. Implement a &quot;create game&quot; button or action that triggers game creation, rather than having it happen automatically. This way the client has more explicit control over when a new game is created.&#10;&#10;4. Add a timestamp to each game entity and only allow creating a new game if the last one was created more than X seconds ago. This adds a throttle to game creation.&#10;&#10;5. On game creation success, have the client wait for some event from the host (e.g. game start event) before allowing subsequent game creation. This syncs the two clients.&#10;&#10;6. On the server, reject duplicate game creation attempts from the same client based on user ID or other metadata.&#10;&#10;The key is adding checks and throttles to prevent rapid repeated game creation, and syncing the two clients so they are in agreement on when a new game should be created." />
